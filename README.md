# ðŸ’° Investment Calculator

A simple **investment calculator** built with React.  
This is an **educational project** that demonstrates how to use React for building interactive applications with dynamic inputs and computed results.

## ðŸš€ Features
- User input for initial investment, annual investment, expected return, and duration  
- Automatic recalculation of results on input changes  
- Validation for duration (must be greater than zero)  
- Tabular output showing yearly growth, interest, and invested capital  
- Clean and reusable React components (`Header`, `UserInput`, `Results`)  

## ðŸ“š React Concepts Demonstrated
- **Components** â€“ splitting UI into smaller reusable parts  
- **Props** â€“ passing data and event handlers to child components  
- **State (`useState`)** â€“ managing dynamic input values  
- **Derived state** â€“ computed data via helper functions (`calculateInvestmentResults`)  
- **Conditional rendering** â€“ error message for invalid input  
- **Event handling** â€“ updating state on input changes
